# wtf wrong answer
```sql
SELECT
  DISTINCT -- using distinct as a hack to get only one element
	 ROUND(
      IFNULL(
          (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id  FROM RequestAccepted) as B)
          /
          (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id  FROM friendRequest) as A)
      ,0)
      
    ,2)  as accept_rate 
FROM -- i don't need FROM
    friendRequest as fr, requestAccepted as ra
```

# Correct answer
```sql
-- Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT
    ROUND(
      IFNULL( -- if null sets default value if no elements in table
          (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id  FROM RequestAccepted) as B) -- as B because is a subtable being generated.. so I don't need it
          /
          (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id  FROM friendRequest) as A) 
      ,0)
      
    ,2)  as accept_rate
```
