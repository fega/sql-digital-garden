# Solution

```sql
SELECT( -- wrapping a SELECT in SELECT, ensures you set null when the inner select returns empty
    SELECT 
    num
    FROM
        mynumbers
    GROUP BY 
        num
        HAVING count(num) = 1
    ORDER BY
        num DESC
    LIMIT 
        1
) as NUM

```

# dual Solution
`DUAL` is purely for the convenience of people who require that all [[SELECT]] statements should have `FROM` and possibly other clauses. MySQL may ignore the clauses. MySQL does not require `FROM DUAL` if no tables are referenced.
```sql
SELECT( -- wrapping a SELECT in SELECT, ensures you set null when the inner select returns empty
    SELECT 
    num
    FROM
        mynumbers
    GROUP BY 
        num
        HAVING count(num) = 1
    ORDER BY
        num DESC
    LIMIT 
        1
) as NUM
FROM dual
