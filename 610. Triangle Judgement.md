# Missing information
https://stackoverflow.com/a/55341720

Your answer is actually right. But the one little information **(Triangle's 'Right' Definition)** is missing on the question (which is not your fault) that **if two sides' sum is bigger OR EQUAL to another side then it's not a triangle**

```sql
SELECT
    *,
    IF(
        x + y > z AND
        x + z > y AND
        z + y > x
        
    , 'Yes', 'No')  as triangle
FROM
    triangle

```

[[IF]]
